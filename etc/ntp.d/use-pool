# iburst tells it to send the first few requests at 2 second intervals rather
# than wait for the poll interval, which defaults to 64 seconds.  That greatly

# You can speed up initialization, and spread the load better, by
# using a country-specific potion of the pool, e.g. something like

# us.pool.ntp.org

# and then try prepending it to ".pool.ntp.org" and pinging that.
